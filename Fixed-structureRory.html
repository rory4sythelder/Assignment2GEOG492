    <h1> Towns of the Illinois Valley in Southern Oregon. <h1>
        <p class="description">The Illinois Valley is located in the southern half of Josephine County, with Hayes Hill being the northern edge and the California border serving roughly as the southern edge. The Illinois Valley has around 12,000 residents spread primarily across the communities of Cave Junction, Selma, and O'Brien. These communities all lie along Highway 199, the "Redwood Highway," which runs from Grants Pass, Oregon to Crescent City, California. Other communities in the valley include Takilma, Holland, and Kerby, none of which have post offices. Takilma lies a few miles west of O'Brien, and is known for the Out n About Treehouse Resort as well as having a large amount of hippies. Holland is located several miles west of Cave Junction and north of Takilma, and has one small store and gas station. It is the most agricultural part of the Illinois Valley due to the flatter land and better soil. Kerby is located barely a mile north of Cave Junction along Highway 199, and has a store, motel, museum, bar, and art gallery.</p>

    <h1>   Cave Junction, OR: </h1>
    <p class="description">Cave Junction is the only incorporated city and the largest population center in the Illinois Valley with 2,052 residents as of 2023.

There are two high schools, Illinois Valley High and Kalmiopsis Community Arts Charter School, which was founded in 2023.</p>
